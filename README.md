# Blockchain Network Analytics Pipeline

Automated ETL pipeline for collecting Bitcoin network metrics and visualizing them in interactive dashboards

## Project Goals

This project serves as a practical exploration of modern data engineering practices:

- **Hands-on with Apache Airflow 3** — Building production-ready orchestration workflows
- **Real-world impact** — Delivering actionable blockchain metrics to stakeholders ( My Friend :) )
- **Technology exploration** — Mastering new tools and integrating them into pipelines
